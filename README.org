* Database

To run the database you'll need JDK and Maven.
The commands should work for Linux and macOS, they may be slightly different on Windows.

Change directory into cw-db. Then run =./mvnw exec:java@server= to start the server.
Then in a new terminal instance, to start the client with =./mvnw exec:java@client=. This should now be running the prompt.

The Database persistently stores data in the local file system.

The query language supports the following commands: ~USE, CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER, DELETE, DROP, JOIN~

** Example

With the following commands, each line should return =[OK]=:

#+begin_src sql
CREATE DATABASE markbook;
USE markbook;
CREATE TABLE marks (name, mark, pass);
INSERT INTO marks VALUES ('Jenny', 20, TRUE);
INSERT INTO marks VALUES ('Rob', 35, FALSE);
SELECT * FROM marks;
#+end_src

This last command should return:

#+begin_example
id	name	mark	pass
3	Jenny	20	TRUE
4	Rob	35	FALSE
#+end_example
