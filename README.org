* Database

To run the database you'll need JDK and Maven.
The commands should work for Linux and macOS (they may be slightly different on Windows).

1. After cloning the repo, change directory into cw-db.
2. Run =./mvnw exec:java@server= to start the server.
3. In a new terminal instance, start the client with =./mvnw exec:java@client=. This should now be running the prompt.

The Database persistently stores data in the local file system.

The query language supports the following commands: ~USE, CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER, DELETE, DROP, JOIN~

** Example

With the following commands, each line should return =[OK]=:

#+begin_src sql
CREATE DATABASE markbook;
USE markbook;
CREATE TABLE marks (name, mark, pass);
INSERT INTO marks VALUES ('Jenny', 20, TRUE);
INSERT INTO marks VALUES ('Rob', 35, FALSE);
SELECT * FROM marks;
#+end_src

This last command should return:

#+begin_example
id	name	mark	pass
3	Jenny	20	TRUE
4	Rob	35	FALSE
#+end_example
